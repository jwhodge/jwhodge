- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwhodge (Jonathan) 

I've worked as a senior manager and creative producer in arts and entertainment for over 10 years. I've worked in many other facets of performing arts for the 10 years before that. But ... my first undergraduate degree was a B.Sc. in Management Science. I took a lot of the project management side of that into producing projects but the data science elements haven't been touched for a while. 

So when the pandemic shut down live entertainment, it left me with time to explore old interests. First it was website development, wordpress and SEO. Then I found freeCodeCamp and got busy. 

- 👀 I’m interested in web and UX design so I started my studies there. However, I still discovering exactly which part of the code landscape really  gets me excited. 

I'd also like to explore the field of data science. My previous study explored many of the methods by which data is explored but the software and programming tools have developed immensly. I'd like to explore Python and its libraries in the future.  

I'm also a believer in opensource software and have run linux on my desktop for over 10 years now.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about frontend development libraries on freeCodeCamp. 

This follows on from the courses I've completed in Responsive Web Design and Javascript Algorithms and Datastructures. I'm aiming to work through their curriculum as a base for my studies. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure.

I'm still early in my journey but I'm aware there are many small constributions I can make to opensource projects. I'd like that to be in my future fairly soon. Hit me up.

- 📫 How to reach me ...

Right now ... open an issue on here.
