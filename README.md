👋 Hi, I'm @jwhodge (Jonathan) 

I've worked as a senior manager and creative producer in arts and entertainment for over ten years. I've worked in many other facets of performing arts for the ten years before that. But ... my first undergraduate degree was a B.Sc. in Management Science. I took a lot of the project management side into producing projects, but I've not used the data science elements for a while. 

So when the pandemic shut down live entertainment, it left me with time to explore old interests. First, it was website development, WordPress and SEO. Then I found freeCodeCamp and got busy. 

👀 I'm interested in web and UX design, so I started my studies there. However, I still discovering exactly which part of the code landscape gets me excited. 

I'd also like to explore the field of data science. In my previous study, I examined many methods to analyse data, but the software and programming tools have developed immensely. So, I want to explore Python and its libraries in the future.  

I'm also a believer in open-source software and have run Linux on my desktop for over ten years.

🌱 I'mI'm currently learning about frontend development libraries on freeCodeCamp. 

This course follows courses in Responsive Web Design and Javascript Algorithms and Datastructures which I'veI've already completed. I'm aiming to work through their curriculum as a base for my studies. 

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on ... I'm not sure yet.

I'm still early in my journey, but I'm aware I can make many small contributions to open-source projects. I'd like that to be in my future reasonably soon. Hit me up.
